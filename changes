User Edit changes.

Need to be finished: UserService::processEditRequest(). Also make sure the DTO as well as the HTML handle not changing a field. Preferably by making the current values the default ones inside. Not with ${placeholder} attribute, but maybe already with ${value} attribute.


AvatarController::POST mapping

Note: The POST mapping should handle cases of changing avatars, not only uploading them. But Java is being a bitch and refuses to work with HTTP codes without crashing. So the controller has to be carefully setup around the try/catch blocks, with more than one POST requests inside it.
The idea is to probe with one POST, check if it conflits(or returns 409), if it does, then we delete that user's avatar and POST it another avatar
It is a hack, but oh well. We live and we learn.
